Make your own! Follow\nthese guidelines to ensure visual consistency and proper formatting.\n\n- All app icons should be unique and not redundant with any existing app icon in\n  the system. Look through the icons in the `App_Icon_Master.ai` file from the\n  [app icons repo](https://github.ibm.com/carbon/app-icons) to ensure that your\n  proposed new icon won’t be confused with other app icons.\n- All app icons should adhere to the [IBM Design Language visual style](/).\n- All app icons should comply with IBM\n  [accessibility standards](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/accessibility/overview).\n- All app icons should be usable across all supported platforms and devices.\n- All app icons should be understandable by a global audience of users,\n  regardless of nationality or language.\n\n## Making an app icon\n\n- Create a 32 x 32 px artboard for each app icon. The `App_Icon_Builder.ai` file\n  on the [app icons repo](https://github.ibm.com/carbon/app-icons) provides\n  proper specs and grid lines.\n- 32 px app icons should have 2 px padding.\n- Set your workspace up from the start to snap to pixels.\n- Be aware of automatic alignments which can place vectors on uneven or half\n  pixels.\n\n### Stroke app icon masking\n\nStroke app icons feature both color and alpha channel gradients. This technique\ncan be achieved in Adobe Illustrator using masking. Follow these guidelines to\ncreate proper gradient masks.\n\n1. Draw a 32 x 32 px square and apply a color gradient. Set the angle to 45° and\n   place the gradient slider locations at 10% and 90%.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colMd={8} colLg={12}>\n\n![Stroke app icon masking: step 1](/images/3_2-1_MakingAnIcon_Stroke_Step1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n2. Place the artwork to be in color above the color square. Make sure the color\n   is set to `#FFFFFF` white.\n3. Place black gradients on the parts of the icon to be masked. Set both\n   gradient sliders to `#000000` black, and set one slider to 0% opacity. Any\n   part of the artwork in black will be transparent after masking.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colMd={8} colLg={12}>\n\n![Stroke app icon masking: step 3](/images/3_2-2_MakingAnIcon_Stroke_Step3.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n4. Open the transparency panel `Window` → `Transparency`.\n5. Group all gradients with the white icon `Object` → `Group`.\n6. Select both the new group and the color square, then click `Make Mask` in the\n   transparency panel.\n\n<Video\n  poster=\"/images/3_2-3_MakingAnIcon_Stroke_Step6_PosterImage.png\"\n  src=\"/videos/3_2-3_MakingAnIcon_Stroke_Step6.mp4\"\n/>\n\n## Exporting SVGs for product and web\n\nTo be considered production-ready for product and web, confirm the following:\n\n- All artwork and artboards must be aligned to the pixel grid.\n- All strokes must be expanded `Object` → `Expand`.\n- All possible shapes and paths should be combined.\n- Use only linear gradients. Do not use conical gradients, radial gradients, or\n  gradients along stroke.\n- For stroke app icons, use the masking method described in the previous\n  section. Do not use clipping masks.\n- If your icon **is not** a stroke app icon, then you will need to place a 32 x\n  32 px transparent square background on each artboard. This square should have\n  no fill or stroke to ensure that the icons maintains a squared size.\n\nApp icons for product and web are created for all background types. This ensures\nyour icon will be accessible in any UI context. Note that these SVGs will work\nin product and web, but may not render correctly in Sketch. For designing in\nsketch, export as PNG.\n\n1. Download the `App_Icon_Builder.ai` file from the\n   [app icons repo](https://github.ibm.com/carbon/app-icons).\n2. Following app icon guidance, create the following 4 versions of your icon:\n   dark theme, light theme, monochromatic dark theme, monochromatic light theme.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colMd={8} colLg={12}>\n\n![Exporting for product and web: step 2](/images/3_3-1_ExportingProduct_Step2.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n3. Make sure your background layer is turned off.\n4. Select `File` → `Export for Screens...` from the top navigation.\n5. In the `Formats` section, click the gear icon to open\n   `Advanced settings for exported file types`. Select `SVG` and enter the\n   following settings:\n\n<Row>\n<Column colMd={6} colLg={8}>\n\n![Exporting for product and web: step 5](/images/3_3-2_SVGSettings.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n6. In the `Formats` section, select the SVG format.\n7. Click `Export Artboard`. Your file will export to SVG.\n\n## Exporting for native OS\n\nThe app icon template makes it easy to export native app icons for any\nenvironment at every size you need. Refer to the read-me file in the template to\nautomate your export process, or follow the guidance here to export manually.\n\n1. Download `App_Icon_Template.zip` from the\n   [app icons repo](https://github.ibm.com/carbon/app-icons).\n2. Place the 32 x 32 px app icon in the `Place_Icon_Here.ai` file. Separate\n   foreground icon elements from background elements and place on the respective\n   artboards.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colMd={8} colLg={12}>\n\n![Foreground and background layers for native OS](/images/3_4-1_ExportingNative_Step2.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n3. Create your icon background in the `App_Icon_Background_Color.ai` file and\n   save.\n4. Open the `App_Icon_Export.ai` file. The artboards should have updated to\n   include your icon.\n5. Select `File` → `Export` → `Export for Screens` from the top navigation.\n6.

Design review and approval\ntypically take 14–21 days from issue creation, depending on the number of icons\ncontributed.\n\nIf your submission is accepted, the team will assign someone to your issue. If\nchanges are needed, the team will note them in the issue and may return your\nsubmission with recommendations or suggest reworking the icon based on feedback\nfrom the Design System and Brand teams.\n\nOnce the submission is approved it will then go through our process to be\nincluded into the IBM app icon gallery. Please submit app icons for approval by\n[creating an issue](https://github.ibm.com/carbon/app-icons/issues/new?template=app-icon-approval-request.md).\n\n### Submission requirements\n\nYou must include the following files in your submission (if applicable).

Design review and approval\ntypically take 14–21 days from issue creation, depending on the number of icons\ncontributed.\n\nIf your submission is accepted, the team will assign someone to your issue. If\nchanges are needed, the team will note them in the issue and may return your\nsubmission with recommendations or suggest reworking the icon based on feedback\nfrom the Design System and Brand teams.\n\nOnce the submission is approved it will then go through our process to be\nincluded into the IBM app icon gallery. Please submit app icons for approval by\n[creating an issue](https://github.ibm.com/carbon/app-icons/issues/new?template=app-icon-approval-request.md).\n\n### Submission requirements\n\nYou must include the following files in your submission (if applicable).
