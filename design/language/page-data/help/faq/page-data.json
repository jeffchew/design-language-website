The design community at IBM is deeply embedded across all key business\nareas: product, brand, services and operations.\n\n</AccordionItem>\n\n<AccordionItem title=\"What’s the IBM Design System (Carbon Design System)?\">\n  Carbon is our open source design system for digital products, software\n  applications and experiences. With the IBM Design Language as its foundation,\n  the system consists of components, patterns, working code, design tools and\n  resources, human interface guidelines and a vibrant community of contributors.\n</AccordionItem>\n\n<AccordionItem title=\"What’s IBM Digital Design?\">\n  IBM Digital Design is the design practice in IBM for all web experiences that\n  are part of the ibm.com platform. Previously known as Northstar or the v18\n  design system, IBM Digital Design follows the IBM Design Language and uses\n  Carbon as its core design system. IBM Digital Design is responsible for\n  publishing the web standards as defined by the IBM Design Language, SEO,\n  Privacy, and Accessibility teams at IBM. IBM Digital Design integrates with\n  Carbon to provide the single design system for ibm.com.\n</AccordionItem>\n\n<AccordionItem title=\"What’s the ibm.com Library?\">\n  The ibm.com Library is the foundational framework through which IBM Design\n  Language is realized on ibm.com. It consists of components specific to\n  ibm.com, web-optimized Carbon components, layout patterns, code snippets,\n  design kits and usage guidelines.\n</AccordionItem>\n\n<AccordionItem title=\"How does the IBM Design Language site relate to the IBM Brand Center? \">\n  The IBM Brand Center represents the IBM brand definition, architecture and\n  high-level guidance and templates used across the brand worldwide.

It\n  expresses the IBM brand in a digital system, visual and verbal assets, and\n  actionable guidance. Implementing it creates a stronger, more unified brand\n  presence across the business with greater efficiencies, point of view (POV),\n  curation and instant recognition. The design philosophy informs the IBM Design\n  Language and expresses the POV on design for IBM.\n</AccordionItem>\n\n</Accordion>\n\n## Guidance and contributions\n\n<Accordion>\n\n<AccordionItem title=\"Can I contribute to IBM Design Language or the disciplines, for example, Product Design, Digital Design, Event and so on?\">\n\nYes, there are multiple ways to contribute to the IBM Design Language.
