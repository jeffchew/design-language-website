Be careful of custom path animation\n  and rely on `position`, `rotation` and `scale`.\n- Ensure gradients track with strokes as they move through the frame.\n- Apply simple camera moves on rare occasions, but only if they further the\n  message.\n- Utilize shape layers in Adobe After Effects to create rectangles and circles\n  to maintain flexibility, while ensuring precision.\n\n### Gradients\n\nGradients can add interest to uncomplicated animations but can be technically\nchallenging to execute well. When illustrating for motion, avoid creating or\nanimating complex gradients unless they’re necessary to convey the message.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n<GifPlayer className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  playsInline\n  autoPlay\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/illustration/ls-gradients-1.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Gradient usage](../images/ls-gradients-1.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n<Caption>Use gradients if they’re relevant to the concept.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n<GifPlayer className=\"video-player\">\n\n<Video\n  playsInline\n  autoPlay\n  loop=\"on\"\n  muted\n  src=\"/videos/illustration/ls-gradients-2.mp4\"\n/>\n\n![Gradient usage](../images/ls-gradients-2.png)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n<Caption>\n  Avoid complex gradients if the message can be conveyed without it.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n### Offset and overlap\n\nWhen offsetting the movement of objects, it’s crucial that we prevent\noverlapping linework. Closely offset elements feel guided and finely\nchoreographed.
