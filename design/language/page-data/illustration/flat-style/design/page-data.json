In it you’ll find correctly drawn grids for flat style illustrations, guidance on the underlying anatomy of the style and a fundamental set of simple elements you can use or recombine to form your own new illustration narrative. The kit includes an inspiration gallery of examples showing techniques you can use in this style. These examples aren’t a library of ready-made art; they’re solely provided to help inform your explorations. Use them to study and deconstruct the technical aspects of this delightfully bold style.\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Flat style kit (.ai)\"\n      aspectRatio=\"2:1\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/design-language-website/raw/master/src/pages/illustration/Illustration-flat-style-kit_v1.ai\"\n      actionIcon=\"download\"\n      >\n\n![illustrator Icon](../../../images/resource-cards/illustrator.png)\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n\n## Examples\n\n![Flat style illustration example 1](./images/flat-1.png)\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Flat style illustration example 2](./images/flat-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Flat style illustration example 3](./images/flat-3.png)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Flat style illustration example 4](./images/flat-4.png)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n![Flat style illustration example 5](./images/flat-5.svg)\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Flat style illustration example 6](./images/flat-6.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Flat style illustration example 7](./images/flat-7.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Flat style illustration example 8](./images/flat-8.png)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n## Shapes\n\nObjects in flat style illustrations should use basic geometric shapes as the\nfoundation. An illustrator can effectively draw most any object or scene by\nartfully combining squares, circles, rectangles and triangles.\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![basic shapes example](./images/shapes-1-mobile.svg)\n![basic shapes example](./images/shapes-1.svg)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![combining shapes example 1](./images/shapes-2.svg)\n\n<Caption>Two squares and two circles to make an eye.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![combining shapes example 2](./images/shapes-3.svg)\n\n<Caption>Two circles and one square to make a heart.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n### Size and spacing\n\nAll objects within a flat style illustration should be at least 8px wide or\ntall. This measurement is very important as using a shape any thinner or shorter\nwill be seen as a line and will change the character of your illustration.\nSimilarly, any negative space or spacing between shapes should also be a minimum\nof 8px.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Spacing example](./images/spacing-1.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Spacing example](./images/spacing-2.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n## Grid\n\nBuilding off of the [2x Grid](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/2x-grid), the\nunderlying grid for flat style has been set at 8px, as opposed to 4px for the\nline style grid. This method will ensure that your minimum shape size and\nspacing is at least 8px and will also help make sure that your illustrations\ndon’t become overly crowded and busy.\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![flat style elements applied to grid](./images/grid-mobile.png)\n![flat style elements applied to grid](./images/grid.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n### Snapping to grid\n\nFlat style illustrations should be constructed using the “snap to grid” feature\nin Adobe Illustrator. This setting ensures that the points along your drawing\ncan snap to the grid lines underneath your linework. The grid positioning of the\nline gives the precise and engineered aesthetic, which is vital to any IBM\nillustration.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Do make sure the anchor point lands clearly on intersecting grid lines.\">\n\n![anchor point correctly on grid](./images/snapping-do.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t forget to use “snap to grid,” or it may result in misaligned anchor points.\">\n\n![anchor point misaligned](./images/snapping-dont.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Layering\n\nWhen shapes are layered there should be at least an 8px safe area so that the\nobjects clearly intersect each other.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Do use clearly arranged shapes with at least 8px of separation.\">\n\n![anchor point correctly on grid](./images/layering-do.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t use haphazardly placed shapes with less than 8px of separation.\">\n\n![anchor point misaligned](./images/layering-dont.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Drawing\n\nObjects in flat style illustration should be built using basic geometric shapes.\nAn illustrator can effectively draw most any object or scene by artfully\ncombining squares, circles, rectangles and triangles.

Using\nthese standard angles will help your illustrations appear consistent. Although\nyou can use any angle, we recommend sticking with the standard angles suggested\nhere.\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![recommended angles](./images/angles-mobile.svg)\n![recommended angles](./images/angles.svg)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n### Circular curves\n\nCreate curves using the grid as your guide and use quarter circles, semicircles\nand full circles whenever possible to achieve pure and simple curved shapes.\nFollowing this guidance will help ensure the engineered aesthetic.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>\n\n![circular curves applied to grid](./images/curves-1.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>\n\n![circular curves illustration example](./images/curves-2.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont caption=\"Do use clear and regular curves when possible.\">\n\n![regular curves example](./images/curves-do.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t use irregular curves if they can be avoided.\">\n\n![irregular curves example example](./images/curves-dont.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Organic curves\n\nOrganic Bézier curves may be used to add more realism and character to your\nillustration, but should be used intentionally and with precision.

When layering shapes in flat\nstyle illustrations, it’s necessary to distinguish shapes, which often relies on\nthe use of various shading techniques. For general approaches to color, please\nvisit the illustration\n[tips and techniques](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/illustration/tips-and-techniques)\npage.\n\n### Gradients and shading\n\nGradients can be an effective way of adding more fidelity to your illustration\nby implying depth, dimension and movement. They can also be an effective and\nnecessary means of creating definition between neighboring shapes.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![gradient example](./images/gradient-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![shading example](./images/flat-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n### Transparency\n\nIn most cases, it’s recommended to use opaque shapes and avoid the use of\nlighting effects, such as transparency and multiply. This technique helps ensure\nconsistent colors across all our illustrations. Transparency effects can still\nbe implied by carefully use of swatches from the palette or by using gradients\nwhere one of the swatches blends into the background.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![transparency example 1](./images/transparency-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![transparency example 2](./images/flat-6.svg)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"4b4ac596b1f5e69ae48a184cb6a44548","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1679},"frontmatter":{"title":"Flat style","description":"Flat style illustrations use basic geometric shapes to suggest people, objects, places and concepts using elements such as grid and color.","tabs":["Design","Usage"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Flat style\ndescription:\n  Flat style illustrations use basic geometric shapes to suggest people,\n  objects, places and concepts using elements such as grid and color.\ntabs: [Design, Usage]\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nFlat style is the boldest and most graphic illustration style used at IBM.
