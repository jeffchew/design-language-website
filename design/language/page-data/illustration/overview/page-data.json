Our illustrations aim to be engineered, clear, nimble, diverse and delightful to create the best possible experience for viewers. These principles capture fundamental ideas that are important to the IBM point of view for illustrations and their overall effectiveness regardless of size or medium.\n\n<!-- Container div for margin-top spacing -->\n<div>\n<Row class=\"narrativeTable\">\n\n<Column colLg={4} noGutter>\n\n### Engineered\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colLg={8} noGutter>\n\nIBM illustrations should feel engineered with a strong sense of balance and control.
