Its consistent, visible use reinforces the IBM\nbrand, makes it more memorable and authenticates the things to which it’s\napplied. It’s an essential component of the IBM look—used to lend authority and\nengender trust wherever it appears. It’s our responsibility to protect it.\n\n_Note: The black stripes have been drawn thicker than the white stripes. The\nblack and white should appear to be similar optically._\n\n![IBM 8-bar logo drawn on grid](/images/8bar.svg)\n\n### Reversed 8-bar\n\nThe logotype has been adjusted to work well reversed on dark backgrounds. In\nthis case, the white stripes are thinner than the black stripes to adjust for\noptical differences, but, like the positive version, the stripes should appear\nsimilar in weight.\n\n![IBM 8-bar logo on grid, reversed](/images/8bar-neg.svg)\n\n### Positive and reversed\n\nIn addition to the differences in bar thickness between the positive and\nreversed versions, there have been adjustments to the points in the counter\nshape. The positive being a sharp and the reversed more blunt. This subtle\ndifference between the two ensures optical integrity on light or dark\nbackgrounds.\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![positive /negative 8 bar](/images/pos-neg-1.svg)\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![positive /negative 8 bar](/images/pos-neg-2.svg)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Legal requirements\n\nThe IBM logo should appear on every piece of official IBM communication.

Any background color from\nthe [IDL color palette](/color#the-palette) with sufficient contrast may be used\nwith a core color 8-bar logo. Here are a few examples of possible color\ncombinations.\n\n<Title>Positive logo</Title>\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Gray 100 on Blue 20](/images/background_gray100_on_blue20.svg)\n\n<Caption>Gray 100 / Blue 20</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Blue 70 on Green 10](/images/background_blue70_on_green10.svg)\n\n<Caption>Blue 70 / Green 10</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Blue 80 on Purple 30](/images/background_blue80_on_purple30.svg)\n\n<Caption>Blue 80 / Purple 30</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Title>Reversed logo</Title>\n\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Blue 40 on Purple 90](/images/background_blue40_on_purple90.svg)\n\n<Caption>Blue 40 / Purple 90</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![Gray 10 on Teal 90](/images/background_gray10_on_teal90.svg)\n\n<Caption>Gray 10 / Teal 90</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n![White on Magenta 60](/images/background_white_on_magenta60.svg)\n\n<Caption>White / Magenta 60</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Colors to avoid\n\nNever apply colors to the 8-bar logo that are outside of the blue and gray\nfamilies and make sure to adhere to the five “steps” away rule for contrast\nbetween the foreground and background. Don’t use unapproved color combinations\nthat have been noted in the [IBM color palette guidance](/color#color-families).\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t use colors that aren’t the core colors for the IBM logo.\" >\n\n![example of colors not to use](images/logo_colordont_1.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t break the five “steps” away rule.\">\n\n![example of colors not to use](images/logo_colordont_2.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t use unapproved color combinations.\">\n\n![example of colors not to use](images/logo_colordont_3.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t create stripes using different colors.\">\n\n![example of colors not to use](images/logo_colordont_4.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t make each letter a different color.\">\n\n![example of colors not to use](images/logo_colordont_5.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t use a gradient to color the logo.\">\n\n![example of colors not to use](images/logo_colordont_6.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Usage\n\nConsider these important points when using the logo across a wide range of\napplications. Careful use and consideration are a requirement to maintain the\nintegrity of the logo in any type of environment or experience. The logo\nshouldn’t be altered in any way and should always adhere to this usage guidance.\n\n### Clear space\n\nThe IBM 8-bar logo should always be clearly visible. Keep the logo separated\nfrom other visual elements by a distance equal to its height. This distance is\nconsidered the minimum uninterrupted space surrounding the logo. We call it the\narea of isolation, or clear space, and it should be adhered to in most\nsituations.\n\n![IBM 8-bar logo showing proper clear space ratio](images/logo-clearspace.png)\n\n### Alignment\n\nThe IBM 8-bar logo has both horizontal and vertical relationships with the\nbusiness units and hero brand logotypes. In either axis, the IBM logo is based\non the cap height of the logotype or can scale larger by the ratio outlined in\nthe next section that follows. Please make sure to use the appropriate positive\nor reversed version of the logo.\n\n![logo alignments](images/logo_alignments.svg)\n\n### Scale relationships\n\nThe IBM logo has several size relationships with logotypes. These relationships\nare driven by the cap height of the logotypes and ensure a nice balance with the\nIBM logo. The logo can “hang” from the cap height or align to the baseline when\nthe logos are placed near the bottom edge of a layout or footer.\n\n![logo scale](images/logo-scale.svg)\n\n### Usage on photography\n\nThe logo should be carefully placed on photography. Always place the logo on\nclear and simple backgrounds with plenty of contrast for legibility. Avoid\nplacing the logo on busy or complex backgrounds or images to keep it as legible\nas possible.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"do\" colLg={6} caption=\"Always place the logo on clear and simple backgrounds.\">\n\n![logo on photography example](images/photography-do-1.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"do\" colLg={6} caption=\"Always place the logo on backgrounds with plenty of contrast for legibility.\">\n\n![logo on photography example](images/photography-do-2.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" colLg={6} caption=\"Never place the logo on images that don’t provide enough contrast.\">\n\n![logo on photography example](images/photography-dont-1.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" colLg={6} caption=\"Never place the logo on busy or complex backgrounds.\">\n\n![logo on photography example](images/photography-dont-2.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n<!-- Add this bit back in when small scale logo will be available to download.\n### Digital usage for small scales\nFor small scale use, we have altered the 8-bar logo to take advantage of pixels. This alteration renders a crisper appearance for the 8-bars. Without the adjustments, anti-aliasing causes visual banding that creates a fuzzy effect on our logo. To avoid poor rendering, please choose this small-scale version in digital work where the logo is used below 32px.\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n![Original logo](/images/small-logo-original-2.png)\n<Caption>Original logo</Caption>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n![Optimized logo](/images/small-logo-optimized-2.png)\n<Caption>Optimized logo</Caption>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n![Original logo detail, zoomed in](/images/small-logo-original-zoom.png)\n<Caption>Original logo detail, zoomed in</Caption>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n![Optimized logo detail, zoomed in](/images/small-logo-optimized-zoom.png)\n<Caption>Optimized logo detail, zoomed in</Caption>\n</Column>\n</Row>  -->\n\n### Things to avoid\n\nThe 8-bar logo shouldn’t be placed into container shapes, altered or embellished\nin any way. It should only be used in the appropriate colors from the IBM color\npalette.

The following timeline illustrates its journey.\n\n![logo lineage](images/logo-lineage.png)\n\n## Co-branding\n\nCo-branding, also called “joint branding,” is when two companies form an\nalliance to work together to market a related set of products or services that\nneither company could develop or promote as effectively alone. IBM rarely\nco-brands and the approval process is rigorous. For more information about the\nco-branding process, please visit IBM Brand Center.\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle={<>IBM co-branding<br />(IBM ID required)</>}\n      href=\"https://www.ibm.com/brand/ibm-logos/co-branding\"\n      >\n\n![bee image](../../images/resource-cards/bee.png)\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Third-party logo usage\n\nThere are multiple categories of IBM logo use requests we consider to be third\nparty. These requests may come from vendors or organizations that want to market\ntheir solutions as enabled by IBM, associations and events IBM has sponsored\naround the world, or co-marketing requests. Each request is evaluated\nindividually, with the key criteria being appropriateness, clarity of\nrelationship, clarity of ownership of communications or offering, general\nliability and so on. IBM requires all third parties to comply with these guidelines to ensure a consistent IBM brand identity across all messaging.\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      actionIcon=\"download\"\n      subTitle={\"IBM logo and brand guidelines for third-party users\"}\n      href=\"https://www.ibm.com/design/language/files/IBM_Logo_3rdParties_300822.pdf\"\n      >\n\n![IBM logo](../../images/resource-cards/acrobat.png)\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"6d6dc57a724222031e4480ea97695d19","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1690},"frontmatter":{"title":"8-Bar","description":"The IBM logo is a major corporate asset with specific legal requirements.

Don’t use unapproved color combinations\nthat have been noted in the [IBM color palette guidance](/color#color-families).\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t use colors that aren’t the core colors for the IBM logo.\" >\n\n![example of colors not to use](images/logo_colordont_1.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t break the five “steps” away rule.\">\n\n![example of colors not to use](images/logo_colordont_2.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t use unapproved color combinations.\">\n\n![example of colors not to use](images/logo_colordont_3.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t create stripes using different colors.\">\n\n![example of colors not to use](images/logo_colordont_4.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t make each letter a different color.\">\n\n![example of colors not to use](images/logo_colordont_5.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t use a gradient to color the logo.\">\n\n![example of colors not to use](images/logo_colordont_6.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Usage\n\nConsider these important points when using the logo across a wide range of\napplications. Careful use and consideration are a requirement to maintain the\nintegrity of the logo in any type of environment or experience. The logo\nshouldn’t be altered in any way and should always adhere to this usage guidance.\n\n### Clear space\n\nThe IBM 8-bar logo should always be clearly visible. Keep the logo separated\nfrom other visual elements by a distance equal to its height. This distance is\nconsidered the minimum uninterrupted space surrounding the logo. We call it the\narea of isolation, or clear space, and it should be adhered to in most\nsituations.\n\n![IBM 8-bar logo showing proper clear space ratio](images/logo-clearspace.png)\n\n### Alignment\n\nThe IBM 8-bar logo has both horizontal and vertical relationships with the\nbusiness units and hero brand logotypes. In either axis, the IBM logo is based\non the cap height of the logotype or can scale larger by the ratio outlined in\nthe next section that follows. Please make sure to use the appropriate positive\nor reversed version of the logo.\n\n![logo alignments](images/logo_alignments.svg)\n\n### Scale relationships\n\nThe IBM logo has several size relationships with logotypes. These relationships\nare driven by the cap height of the logotypes and ensure a nice balance with the\nIBM logo. The logo can “hang” from the cap height or align to the baseline when\nthe logos are placed near the bottom edge of a layout or footer.\n\n![logo scale](images/logo-scale.svg)\n\n### Usage on photography\n\nThe logo should be carefully placed on photography. Always place the logo on\nclear and simple backgrounds with plenty of contrast for legibility. Avoid\nplacing the logo on busy or complex backgrounds or images to keep it as legible\nas possible.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"do\" colLg={6} caption=\"Always place the logo on clear and simple backgrounds.\">\n\n![logo on photography example](images/photography-do-1.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"do\" colLg={6} caption=\"Always place the logo on backgrounds with plenty of contrast for legibility.\">\n\n![logo on photography example](images/photography-do-2.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" colLg={6} caption=\"Never place the logo on images that don’t provide enough contrast.\">\n\n![logo on photography example](images/photography-dont-1.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" colLg={6} caption=\"Never place the logo on busy or complex backgrounds.\">\n\n![logo on photography example](images/photography-dont-2.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n<!-- Add this bit back in when small scale logo will be available to download.\n### Digital usage for small scales\nFor small scale use, we have altered the 8-bar logo to take advantage of pixels. This alteration renders a crisper appearance for the 8-bars. Without the adjustments, anti-aliasing causes visual banding that creates a fuzzy effect on our logo. To avoid poor rendering, please choose this small-scale version in digital work where the logo is used below 32px.\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n![Original logo](/images/small-logo-original-2.png)\n<Caption>Original logo</Caption>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n![Optimized logo](/images/small-logo-optimized-2.png)\n<Caption>Optimized logo</Caption>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n<Row className=\"mock-gallery\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n![Original logo detail, zoomed in](/images/small-logo-original-zoom.png)\n<Caption>Original logo detail, zoomed in</Caption>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n![Optimized logo detail, zoomed in](/images/small-logo-optimized-zoom.png)\n<Caption>Optimized logo detail, zoomed in</Caption>\n</Column>\n</Row>  -->\n\n### Things to avoid\n\nThe 8-bar logo shouldn’t be placed into container shapes, altered or embellished\nin any way. It should only be used in the appropriate colors from the IBM color\npalette. The following examples reflect only a handful of samples of what not to\ndo.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t change the direction or weight of the bars.\">\n\n![don't change the direction or weight of the bars example](images/usage-dont-stripe-direction.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t make a dot matrix.\">\n\n![don’t make a dot matrix example](images/usage-dont-dotmatrix.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t extend the serifs to touch each other.\">\n\n![don't extend the serifs to touch each other example](images/usage-dont-serifs-touch.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t outline the bars.\">\n\n![don't outline the bars example](images/usage-dont-outline.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t stretch or compress the logo.\">\n\n![don't stretch or compress the logo example](images/usage-dont-stretch.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t alter the spacing between the letters.\">\n\n![don't alter the spacing between the letters example](images/usage-dont-spacing.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t outline or overlap the letters.\">\n\n![don't outline or overlap the letters example](images/usage-dont-overlap.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t contain the logo in a shape.\">\n\n![don't contain the logo in a shape example](images/usage-dont-container.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t add the smart rays.\">\n\n![don't add the smart rays example](images/usage-dont-thoughtrays.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t add characters in the 8-bar design.\">\n\n![don't add characters in the 8-bar design example](images/usage-dont-add.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t add your own taglines or mottos.\">\n\n![don't add your own taglines or mottos example](images/logo_dont_tagline.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Don’t use drop shadows.\">\n\n![don't use drop shadows example](images/logo_dont_shadow.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Lineage\n\nThe IBM logo transformed through the years as the business it represents grew.\nWhen the company took the name International Business Machines in 1924, the\nbrand evolution of IBM began. The following timeline illustrates its journey.\n\n![logo lineage](images/logo-lineage.png)\n\n## Co-branding\n\nCo-branding, also called “joint branding,” is when two companies form an\nalliance to work together to market a related set of products or services that\nneither company could develop or promote as effectively alone. IBM rarely\nco-brands and the approval process is rigorous. For more information about the\nco-branding process, please visit IBM Brand Center.\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle={<>IBM co-branding<br />(IBM ID required)</>}\n      href=\"https://www.ibm.com/brand/ibm-logos/co-branding\"\n      >\n\n![bee image](../../images/resource-cards/bee.png)\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Third-party logo usage\n\nThere are multiple categories of IBM logo use requests we consider to be third\nparty. These requests may come from vendors or organizations that want to market\ntheir solutions as enabled by IBM, associations and events IBM has sponsored\naround the world, or co-marketing requests. Each request is evaluated\nindividually, with the key criteria being appropriateness, clarity of\nrelationship, clarity of ownership of communications or offering, general\nliability and so on. IBM requires all third parties to comply with these guidelines to ensure a consistent IBM brand identity across all messaging.\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      actionIcon=\"download\"\n      subTitle={\"IBM logo and brand guidelines for third-party users\"}\n      href=\"https://www.ibm.com/design/language/files/IBM_Logo_3rdParties_300822.pdf\"\n      >\n\n![IBM logo](../../images/resource-cards/acrobat.png)\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/runner/work/design-language-website/design-language-website/src/pages/ibm-logos/8-bar.mdx"}}},
