Their thoughtful arrangement, using a wide variety of elements, helps us deliver information with clarity. Based on the IBM Design Language and Carbon Design System, our technical diagrams might describe an IT architecture, show a structural hierarchy or outline the order of a process flow. Beyond the fundamentals for all technical diagrams, the IT architecture subsystem is dedicated to the vizualization of the IBM Unified Method Framework for IT architecture concepts. The product documentation subsystem covers flows, process diagrams and so on. You'll find useful, clear and descriptive guidance for [Design](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/infographics/technical-diagrams/design/) and [Usage](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/infographics/technical-diagrams/usage) on our new Technical diagrams pages.<br/>— <br/>15 June, 2022\n\n## Infograms\n\n<Row className={gridImages}>\n<Column colLg={8} colMd={6}>\n\n[![link to Infograms page](./images/infograms.png)](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/infographics/infograms)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nInfograms are information graphics that mimic the style of IBM pictograms. But unlike the charts found in the IBM pictogram library that illustrate the idea of data visualization, infograms depict real data. Adapted for use in small spaces, the infogram works well as tertiary or marginal data. Stylistically, the infogram pairs with productive pictograms in visual harmony. Discover more about the six types of infograms and how each one provides instant visual comprehension of the data represented on the [Infograms](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/infographics/infograms) page.<br/>— <br/>15 June, 2022\n\n## People illustration\n\n<Row className={gridImages}>\n<Column colLg={8} colMd={6}>\n\n<GifPlayer className=\"video-player\" color=\"dark\">\n\n<Video autoPlay autoStart playsInline loop=\"on\" muted src=\"./videos/PeoplePage_Announcement_Final_v1.mp4\" />\n\n![People illustration](./images/PeoplePage_Announcement_Final_v1.jpeg)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nHumanity is integral to our work. It fosters insights we use to bring people and technologies together that create outcomes larger than we could ever accomplish alone. We celebrate humanity's vast diversity—of personalities, cultures and abilities—through inclusive illustration guidance that features an established aesthetic that’s identifiably IBM.
