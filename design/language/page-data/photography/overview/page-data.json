It’s subjective. But, if we are to guide, as our design philosophy suggests, the photography we use gives us the opportunity to present ourselves as great observers of the working world and to show and tell stories. Our photography should set the scene or create context for the transformational conversations we want to have. It should demonstrate our interest in the world around us, and the positive effects we’re working to deliver as IBMers.\n\nEverything communicates, and our use of imagery is no exception. The care and craft we put into our imagery choices demonstrates our commitment to best-in-class communication and a celebration of the work we do.\n\n![workers in hardware lab](./images/overview/pov-1.jpg)\n\n<Row className=\"gallery-row-padding\">\n<Column colMd={2} colLg={4}>\n\n![tangerines flow on three conveyor belts](./images/overview/pov-2.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={2} colLg={4}>\n\n![portrait of executive wearing suit with hands in pockets](./images/overview/pov-3.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row className=\"gallery-row-padding\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={8} offsetMd={2} offsetLg={4}>\n\n![document archive warehouse with stacked shelves](./images/overview/pov-4.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row className=\"gallery-row-padding\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>\n\n![person working at desk with open field out window](./images/overview/pov-5.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={2} colLg={4}>\n\n![person surrounded by fishing nets](./images/overview/pov-6.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Photo types\n\nGiven our scale and scope, no single photographic style can capture the variety of subjects or themes we need to convey. Different types of images are better suited for certain situations and subject matter. We’ve developed a definitive perspective on the types of imagery that best define IBM in both style and substance.\n\n### **Reportage:** Working world\n\nThe bulk of the photography we use is lifestyle, cinematic and colorful. This choice is intentional. Every day, our work exposes us to different businesses, cultures, geographies, economies, fields and industries. In return, this exposure informs us and inspires our thinking. We proudly present the world as it is. Our approach is editorial, like documentary filmmaking or journalism. The result is images that feel like frames from a film, active and moving in their portrayal of our role in society. We are progressive participants.\n\n<Row className=\"gallery-row-padding\">\n\n<Column colMd={3} colLg={4}>\n\n![person at engineering work bench](./images/overview/reportage-1.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={3} colLg={4}>\n\n![football players leaving field](./images/overview/reportage-2.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n<Row className=\"gallery-row-padding\">\n\n<Column colMd={2} colLg={3}>\n\n![farmer near wall of large hay bales](./images/overview/reportage-3.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={5}>\n\n![farmer inspecting grain harvest](./images/overview/reportage-4.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n### **Portraiture:** Progress partners\n\nProfessionals are to IBM what athletes are to Nike. We champion professionals. Portraiture allows us to isolate individual IBMers, clients and teams, to capture their character, and focus on the unique personalities and perspectives they provide. Our approach is democratic. We never invest more or less photographically based stature or status, but rather with equal skill and high standards. This demonstration is another statement of our emphasis on forward thinkers.\n\n<Row className=\"gallery-row-padding\">\n\n<Column colMd={2} colLg={3}>\n\n![person standing with hands on hips, body facing right, face looking left](./images/overview/portraiture-1.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={5}>\n\n![person looking directly at camera](./images/overview/portraiture-2.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n<Row className=\"gallery-row-padding\">\n\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={5}>\n\n![people working around conference table one person in focus](./images/overview/portraiture-3.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={2} colLg={3}>\n\n![person in welders helmet](./images/overview/portraiture-4.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n### **Still-life:** Exhibiting excellence\n\nGreat imagery is both an art and a science&mdash;equal parts expression and engineering. Still life photography is best suited for celebrating the beauty and creativity of things, showing how things work, conveying concepts and displaying details.
